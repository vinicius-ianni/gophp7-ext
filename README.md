# goPHP7 (extensions)

It's time to make extensions first class citizens of the PHP community
 
## The goals of gophp7(ext)

 1. Get PHP extensions running "out of the box" when PHP7 is released (no lag time)
 2. Make extensions in general easier to install and use (binaries, ppas)
 3. Get more people involved in extension maintainance (and travis/appveyor running on them all, killing off bugs)
 4. Get more documentation written for extension writing
 5. Codify some of the "best practices" of extension writing and design (a la PSR)
  
## Get Involved
